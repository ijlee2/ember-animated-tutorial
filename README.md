# Ember Animated Tutorial

This is the code companion to my [Animation and Predictable Data Loading in Ember](https://crunchingnumbers.live/), presented at the Ember ATX Meetup on 3/28/2019.

## How to Run

The app is not connected to a backend just yet. In the meantime, please run `ember s` on your machine, then visit `localhost:4200`.

You can check how the project should look after each step, by running `git checkout` and specifying the branch name:


| Branch name | Added features                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| starter     | Starter project                      |
| master      | Completed                            |
